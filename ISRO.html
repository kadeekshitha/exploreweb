                Our vision is to harness space technology for national development, while pursuing space science research and planetary exploration.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Indian Space Research Organisation is the national space agency of India, headquartered in Bangalore. ISRO is India's primary agency for performing tasks related to space-based applications, space exploration, and the development of related technologies.The agency was established in 1963 and its programs and spinoff technologies have played a significant role in the socio-economic and industrial development of India and have supported both civilian and military domains in various aspects including disaster management, telemedicine, and navigation and reconnaissance missions. It operates under the Department of Space (DOS) which is directly overseen by the Prime Minister of India, while the Chairman of ISRO acts as the executive of DOS as well.

                ISRO is one of six government space agencies in the world which possess full launch capabilities, deploy cryogenic engines, launch extraterrestrial missions, and operate large fleets of artificial satellites. It has the world's largest constellation of remote-sensing satellites and operates the GAGAN and NAVIC satellite navigation systems. It has sent two missions to the Moon and one to Mars.

            <span>
                The agency's goals for the near future include expanding its satellite fleet, landing a rover on Moon, sending humans into space, development of a semi-cryogenic engine, sending more uncrewed missions to the Moon, Mars, Venus and the Sun, and deployment of more space telescopes in orbit to observe cosmic phenomena and space beyond the Solar System. Long-term plans include development of reusable launchers, heavy and super heavy launch vehicles, deploying a space station, sending exploration missions to the outer planets and asteroids and crewed missions to moons and planets.

                ISRO did not have an official logo until 2002. The one adopted consists of an orange arrow shooting upwards attached with two blue coloured satellite panels with the name of ISRO written in two sets of text, orange-coloured Devanagari on the left and blue-coloured English in the Prakrta typeface on the right.
